        <h2>About Natalia Lafourcade</h2>
        <p>Natalia Lafourcade is a Mexican singer-songwriter who specializes in pop-rock and folk.
            She made her musical debut with her self-titled album in 2002 and as time has
            progressed, she has become a significant figure in Latin America and the world as a
            whole. She pulls on experiences from her past and elements of national imagery and
            patriotic identity to create timeless music that resonates with the latinx community and
            many outside of it.</p>
        <h2>About the Project</h2>
        <p>Our project focuses on analyzing the presence of these folkloric elements in Natalia's
            last three albums: Musas Vol 1, 2, and Un Canto por Mexico Vol 1. By doing so, we hoped
            to get a good idea of how Natalia's implementation of these elements aids her in
            painting the story she creates throughout each album.</p>
