- Autumn Moore is an undergraduate Anthropology major at the University of Pittsburgh who is also pursuing minors in Linguistics and Spanish. Her love of Natalia Lafourcade's music is what initially drove the group to select their research topic. She marked up the most recent album, Un Canto por MÃ©xico Vol. 1, and acted as the final check of how the Spanish text was interpreted.
- Joy Gimei is an undergradutate Information Sceince major at the Univeristy of Pittsburgh with a minor in Spanish. She loves analyzing music and has a pastion for the Spanish language, so when Autumn suggested that Natalia Lafourcade as the artist they should dive into, she was totally on board. She marked up Musas Vol. 1 and assisted the team with the website design.
