- Autumn Moore is an undergraduate Anthropology major at the University of Pittsburgh who is also pursuing minors in Linguistics and Spanish. Her love of Natalia Lafourcade's music is what initially drove the group to select their research topic. She marked up the most recent album, Un Canto por MÃ©xico Vol. 1, and acted as the final check of how the Spanish text was interpreted.
