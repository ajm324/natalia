# 2/22/21 Meeting Minutes

* Exchanged Numbers
* **Make sure to save new documents directly into the folder!!!**
* **Also make sure not to save until the end, but save when you come to a good stopping point.**
* We probably won't be using TEI
* For interludes, determine importance (use regex to get rid of interludes or add an element into the schema that includes them, etc.)
* For getting lyrics: Save each song as a unique document
    * Copy & Paste into a .txt and then convert them into XML
        * Musas Vol. 1: Joy
        * Musas Vol. 2: Grace
        * Un Canto Por Mexico: Autumn
        * Put all text files in folder, but before pushing the empty album folder put files in them
* For next meeting
    * Convert all albums to XML
    * Try and markup two songs (time how long they take)
    * **We can't work on the project at the same time**
    * **Associate Schema**
    * **If using Regex communicate with teamates so it's consistent**
