# 4/5 Meeting

* We had issues with the toc.xhtml, did not input the menu bar in correctly
    * Use one toc.xhtml file, not the same links in each section
    * Issue was Fetching, we need to fetch the table of contents to upload it to the site
* Fixed the SSI links in each page of our site
* Had to work out issues with Fetch, our updated files were not uploading properly
    * Had to manually put each file into Fetch, resolved those issues
* Worked on and completed the drop-down menu element
    * Instead of a link to our songs page, we have a drop down menu to navigate through each of the albums
    * This was edited within our toc.xhtml file
